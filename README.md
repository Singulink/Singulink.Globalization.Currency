**Singulink.Globalization.Currency** is a .NET library that provides types like `Currency`, `MonetaryValue` and a range of collections and interfaces that make it easy to work with money and currencies in your applications while following best practices. The library is well-documented and follows the same design principles as built-in .NET types and collections. It has been painstakingly tested and optimized to ensure that it is both fast and reliable.

### Key Features

✔️ Four types of money bag collections for working with multiple currencies at once  
✔️ Collection expression/literal syntax support  
✔️ Builds currency data from built-in system globalization data  
✔️ Support for custom currency registries, i.e. for cryptocurrency support  
✔️ Generic math support (.NET)  
✔️ Extensive `ReadOnlySpan<char>` lookup support (.NET 9+)  
✔️ Full AOT and WinRT support  
✔️ 700 tests with 90% code coverage
