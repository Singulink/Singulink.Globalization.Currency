**Singulink.Globalization.Currency** is a .NET library that provides types like `Currency`, `Money` and a range of collections and interfaces that make it easy to work with money and currencies in your applications. The library is well-documented and follows the same design principles as built-in .NET types and collections. It has been painstakingly optimized and tested to ensure that it is both fast and reliable.

✔️ Collection expression / collection literal syntax support
✔️ Builds currency data from built-in system globalization data
✔️ Optional Add-on ISO 4217 currency data package
✔️ Can create custom currency registries, i.e. for cryto-currency support
✔️ Generic math support (.NET 7+)
✔️ 600+ tests, 94% code coverage
